Make sure you have Microsoft's Direct X 3 Installed on your machine.
You can get it at xxx.xxx.xx if you do not already have it.

Almost all problems are likely due to your display drivers.  You
should check out the web site of your video card manufacturer or the
Microsoft web site for the latest drivers.  We will also be posting
a list of drivers that are problems and/or how to rectify them on the
RUNANDGUN! Inc. Wild Ride! web page at http://www.runandgun.com/wildride
in the near future.  See the help file for more info.

Wild Ride! only runs in 16 bit color mode, (hi color, or
thousands of colors).  Please ensure that your computer is set to
run in 16 bit color mode by right clicking on the desktop, an
picking properties.  You can select the color mode in the settings
menu.

Note:  If you have a Trident video card, you will most likely require
the latest drivers, which are availiable at http://www.trid.com.
They should be installed AFTER Microsoft's Direct X 3.
